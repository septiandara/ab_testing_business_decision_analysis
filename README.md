This report is prepared for an online store's marketing department. The goal is to see if certain parameter changes in the website and promotion can be used to boost revenue.

The report has two sections:
1. Hypotheses prioritisation: we will use ICE and RICE method to prioritise which hypotheses scores best in its reach, impact, confidence and effort.
2. A/B test analysis: we will compare two customer groups of the online store, and find out which one yields maximum result based on the revenue, order size and conversion rate.

The dataset is eventually filtered to remove outliers and surges, and statistical significance testing was also conducted to see if there is any difference between the results of the two groups.
